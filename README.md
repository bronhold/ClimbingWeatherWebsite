# ClimbingWeatherWebsite

This Website displays the current weatherdata from Locations around Australia and models a full application with a frontend and database.
This project is meant to show the programing skills I have developed so far with a focus on backend development.

The code flow is as follows:
1.  Download latest weather data in json format.
2.  Convert from json objs into a list of C# obj.
3.  Compare list of C# obj with data in the database.
4.  Store any new data in the database.
5.  Retrieves the latest data from the database and passes it to the client
6.  Displays Data in HTML Tables
